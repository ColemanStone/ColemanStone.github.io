    <h3>Welcome! This page is about my journey toward God and the experiences that brought me closer or, at times,
        distanced me from Him.</h3>

<p>Throughout my life, there has always been someone talking about God, Jesus, or faith in general, whether it was my
    parents, grandma, or sister. I’ve never experienced a time when someone close to me spoke negatively about
    Christianity. Does that make me biased toward being a Christian? Perhaps, but this isn’t about questioning my
    faith—just reflecting on what might have influenced my path toward Christ.</p>

<p>My earliest memory of church is being in what I thought was a normal place of worship. I vividly remember a Bible
    story being told by hand puppets. I don’t recall the story, but the puppets left an impression. Later, I remember
    attending a different church with my family, standing during worship, and going to children’s ministry when the kids
    were dismissed. I learned about the birth of Christ, Mary, Joseph, and the early disciples. At that time, I was
    simply following my family and attending church without thinking much about it.</p>

<p>Eventually, my family and I stopped attending church. There was no drama or incident—nothing happened; we just
    stopped going. From then on, I didn’t learn much more about Christ, the Old Testament, or the New Testament. I was
    just living my life. It wasn’t until late 2019 or early 2020 (I don’t remember exactly) when my sister came home
    from work talking about a man named Joel Larison, who was starting a church and using the place where she worked as a
    temporary meeting spot. My mom, dad, sister, and I attended the first service, but I didn’t go back. I didn’t resent
    God or religion; I just didn’t feel like going to church at that time.</p>

<p>Time passed, and that church became Bridgeway Kokomo. During the period I wasn’t attending, they got a building and
    transformed an old bank into a church. They had their first service, but shortly after, the world shut down due to
    COVID. It was during the lockdown that I began to think more deeply about faith. I wasn’t reading the Bible, just
    reflecting on what I knew about Christ, God, and Christianity. When school resumed, I was excited to start my senior
    year in person rather than online. A couple of months in, my sister told me that the worship band at Bridgeway
    needed a bass player. She had mentioned me to the worship director, so I agreed to play, despite knowing little
    about the bass. After one week, I didn’t think much of it, but that moment marked a turning point in my faith
    journey. I had unconsciously decided to start turning my faith toward Christ.</p>

<p>A few months later, I was asked to play bass again. This time, my family also encouraged me to play piano for the
    church. They kept pushing me until I agreed, and from there, things snowballed. Over the next few months, I began
    playing more frequently with the worship band.</p>

<p>By April, after playing with the band for three months, I was considering getting baptized but wasn’t sure what it
    truly meant. When my pastor, Joel, asked if I’d thought about baptism, I realized I wanted to take that step. My
    18th birthday fell on a Sunday, April 18th, and I decided to be baptized that day. It was the first major decision I
    made as an adult, and I have no regrets.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today—it's been over three years since my baptism. I still play with the worship band, primarily on
    guitar and piano, and sometimes help run the soundboard. I’m also involved in the student ministry, where I help
    lead and manage the tech each Sunday night. I’m not sure how to conclude this story, so I’ll just say thank you for
    reading my testimony.</p>
