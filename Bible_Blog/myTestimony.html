<p>Throughout my entire life there has always been someone talking about god, Jesus, or just faith in general. It is my
    parents, grandma, or sister. I have never known a time in my life when someone close to me or my family said
    anything negative about Christianity. Does that make me biased toward being a Christian? I don't know maybe but this
    isn't me questioning my faith. This is just stating things that could have been a factor in me finding my way
    towards Christ.</p>
<p>The earliest. memory I have of the church is being at what would be in my eyes a normal place of worship. I vividly
    remember a story from the bible told my hand puppets. I don't remember what story it was, but I just remember the
    puppets. After that, the next thing I remember is being at a different church with my family and just kinda standing
    during worship and leaving for the children's ministry when it was time for the kids to leave the congregation. I
    remember learning about the birth of Christ and who Mary and Joseph were. I remember learning about the early
    disciples of Jesus when he started preaching the work of God to people. But I was just a kid doing what my family
    was doing and being at church.</p>
<p>After a while me and my family just stopped going to church. There was no drama with the church we were at. Nothing
    happened to anyone we just stopped. Since then, I haven't really learned about Christ, the Old Testament, or the New
    Testament. I was just living my life. It wasn't until late 2019, or early 2020 (I don't exactly remember) when my
    sister came home from work talking about someone named Joel Larson who was starting a church and was going to be
    using the place she worked at the time for the time being since he didn't have anywhere for his church then. Me,
    mom, dad, and my sister went to the first one that they had there. I didn't go again because at that time I didn't
    have a desire to go to church. Again not because I was resenting God or religion. I just didn't want to go.</p>
<p>Time passed and that church was called Bridgeway Kokomo. During the time I didn't go, they ended up getting a
    building and renovating what was a bank into a church. They had their first service then the world shut down due to
    COVID. It was during this time I started to get interested into faith more and more during the lockdown. I wasn't
    reading my bible just thinking about what I know of Christ and God and everything about being Christian. Eventually,
    school started back up and it was my senior year of high school so I was excited because I got to have that be in
    person instead of online. Things changed at school due to covid but I was happy to be back and out of my house. A
    couple months into my senior year my sister came up to me at home and said that the worship band at Bridgway needed
    a bass player and she told the worship director at the time about me and said I would play. So I showed up knowing
    nothing and just played bass for one week. I didn't think anything of it at the time but that was the turning point
    with me and my faith. It was then that I subconsciously made the decision to turn my faith towards Christ. A couple
    months passed after I played bass with the band and I got a request to play again. So I did. Eventually, it got out
    that I play piano after my sister and family told me to play the piano for church and they just pushed me and pushed
    me to do it. I agreed one day and after that, it just snowballed more and more.
<p>
<p>Now it's been about 3 months of playing with the worship band and it was about to be the month of April. Which
    happens to be when my birthday is. I have thought about getting baptized but didn't know what the meaning fully was.
    I didn't know the steps until my Pastor Joel asked me if I thought about getting baptized. April 18th would have
    been my 18th birthday and it fell on a Sunday. I told him that I would like to be baptized that same day and he
    helped me set it up and baptized me. It was the first thing I did as an "adult" life and I have zero regrets about
    that decision.</p>
<p>That all leads up to the modern day now. My baptism was over 3 years ago now and I am still playing with the worship
    band mainly playing guitar and piano but now I also help run the soundboard here and there. I also lead in the
    student ministry by being a leader and helping run all the tech every Sunday night. I don't know how to end this so
    I will just stop typing and I hope you enjoyed reading my Testimony</p>
