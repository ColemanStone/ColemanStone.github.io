        <h2>11/05/24</h2>
        <p>I feel like its appropriate to talk about my faith today considereing its the 2024 election day. I'm not
            going to tatlk about my views on politics. I'm wanting to talk about
            how christens should act around people with different views on politics. "In the same way you judge others,
            you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." Matthew 7:1-2
            This verse from the book of Matthew is saying the way you judge people about something you may not agree
            with will also be judged onto you from someone else. Bringing that into politics, there are people who
            will completely throw away family and friends because they judge them for not voting the same way as them.
            To me the act of leaving family and friends just because of the way they vote is far from being a "true"
            christan.
            "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
            Ephesians 4:32</p>
        <h2>11/06/24</h2>
        <p>My entire life I have had one thing always be there and that one thing is music. "What ever you do, work at
            it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will reveive
            an inheritance from the Lord as a reward." Colossians 3:23-24.
            This verse is always in the back of my mind whenever I am playing music either on stage or alone. Ever since
            I started learning piano when I was about 4 or 5, I haven't stopped. I learned guitar and drums along the
            way to today. I am able to use that gift God game me to worship him in a way
            where I feel connected to him whenever I play on Sundays. Even when I am playing metal songs on guitar I
            still feel that connection, the excitement when I finally learn the riff or solo is the same feeling I get
            when I just get up and play music almost every Sunday.</p>
        <h2>11/10/25</h2>
        <p>I have never had an "experience" with God or the Holy Spirit in the sense of hearing or seeing God clear as
            day. But I do have something that I do experience. Whenever I have something weigh on my mind, I have vivid
            dreams about that situation. It could be me playing a new song or even asking someone to go and do
            something. No matter what it is,
            it either goes good or very, very bad. There has never been a thing that went bad in my dream actually go
            bad when it happens in my life. But the things I worry about going wrong appear in my dreams tend to go
            good. It also goes good in real life after that. "may the God of hope fill you with joy and peace as you
            trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." Romans 15:13.
            This verse makes me think those vivid dreams I have is the Holy Spirit working in me to make me more
            confident and not question myself.</p>
        <h2>11/14/24</h2>
        <p>"A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed." Provers 11:25. This is the
            daily verse on my bible app today. To me this verse should be more popular as Philippians 4:13 because
            Proverbs 11:25 is talking about being generous to other people. You never know what other people are going
            through. Someone could be having the worst time of their life and one complement could change their day and
            can impact how people
            feel about themselves. It doesn't take any energy to be kind, doesn't take any energy to talk so someone
            new. That being said I hope whoever reads this. I hope you have a good day.</p>
        <h2>11/20/24</h2>
        <p>"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; On those living in the land of deep darkness a light
            has dawned." Isaiah 9:2. This verse is a powerful verse to me because it is speaking in people who might
            feel like the things they have done or said makes them unforgivable. When in reality Jesus went for the
            people like Mary who was possessed and used the, to show the true love of God. That same ideology stands
            today. The people who might
            be in the darkest point in their life can still be loved the same as the most religious.</p>
        <h2>11/25/24</h2>
        <p>"Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, and a man with shriveled hand was there. Looking for
            a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him "Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?" he said to
            them, "If any of you have a sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath. Will you not take hold of it and
            lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the
            sabbath." Matthew 12:9-12.
            This is multiple verses showing how many people tried to charge Jesus and show people he didn't do anything
            good and faked his miracles. To me the fact multiple eye witness testimonies that all say the same thing
            makes me believe in all the good Jesus did and the fact he rose from the dead. The fact Jesus did things
            that even today can't be explained in the eyes of science. It's powerful. It's the greatest miracle to ever
            happen apart from God creating human.</p>
        <h2>12/03/24</h2>
        <p>"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Matthew 6:21. To me this verse is powerful
            because I believe things you hold close to your heart like close friends and family is something that is
            worth more than any treasure this world can offer. To me people who hold things like money or status over
            family are the ones who will always be lonely no matter who they surround themselves with.</p>
        <h2>12/09/24</h2>
        <p>"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will
            remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his llve. I have told you this so
            that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete." John 15:9-11. I read these verses to always
            remind myself that if I just keep my faith in the Lord, keep my promises to myself that I told just follow
            what the Lord has commanded I will lead a life of following his as best as I can.
        </p>
        <h2>12/14/24</h2>
        <p>""For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lod. "Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to
            giv eyou hope and a future." Jeremiah 29:11. This verse is one of them that to me is a staple in my faith.
            The fact the lord has a plan for me gives me some peace in mind for where my life will end up. Even though I
            stress about my love life, my career, and anything else that changes throughout life. I know God has a plan
            for it all.</p>
        <h2>12/16/24</h2>
        <p>Something I think abou from time to time is the fact whenever I read about the disciple Matthew, I find
            things bout him that I can relate to in a way. "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon
            (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and
            Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;" Matthew 10;2-3.
            THis verse to me shows that even though Matthewat that point in his life was a completely different man than
            the one before Jesus let him follow him. He still seems himself as the tax collector. It's something that
            would always be apart of himself. Even though its not him anymore. Sometimes I find myself slipping into the
            mindset and see myself as the one before I truely meet Jesus. I slip out of that fast but when I read
            Matthew 10:2-3 for the first time I really felt like what I though Matthew felt like whenever he would refer
            to himself as the tax collector.</p>
