    <h2>11/05/24</h2>
    <p>I feel like its appropriate to talk about my faith today considereing its the 2024 election day. I'm not going to tatlk about my views on politics. I'm wanting to talk about
    how christens should act around people with different views on politics. "In the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." Matthew 7:1-2
    This verse from the book of Matthew is saying the way you judge people about something you may not agree with will also be judged onto you from someone else. Bringing that into politics, there are people who
    will completely throw away family and friends because they judge them for not voting the same way as them. To me the act of leaving family and friends just because of the way they vote is far from being a "true" christan.
    "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." Ephesians 4:32</p>
    <h2>11/06/24</h2>
    <p>My entire life I have had one thing always be there and that one thing is music. "What ever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will reveive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward." Colossians 3:23-24.
    This verse is always in the back of my mind whenever I am playing music either on stage or alone. Ever since I started learning piano when I was about 4 or 5, I haven't stopped. I learned guitar and drums along the way to today. I am able to use that gift God game me to worship him in a way
    where I feel connected to him whenever I play on Sundays. Even when I am playing metal songs on guitar I still feel that connection, the excitement when I finally learn the riff or solo is the same feeling I get when I just get up and play music almost every Sunday.</p>
    <h2>11/10/25</h2>
    <p>I have never had an "experience" with God or the Holy Spirit in the sense of hearing or seeing God clear as day. But I do have something that I do experience. Whenever I have something weigh on my mind, I have vivid dreams about that situation. It could be me playing a new song or even asking someone to go and do something. No matter what it is,
    it either goes good or very, very bad. There has never been a thing that went bad in my dream actually go bad when it happens in my life. But the things I worry about going wrong appear in my dreams tend to go good. It also goes good in real life after that. "may the God of hope fill you with joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." Romans 15:13.
    This verse makes me think those vivid dreams I have is the Holy Spirit working in me to make me more confident and not question myself.</p>
    <h2>11/14/24</h2>
    <p>"A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed." Provers 11:25. This is the daily verse on my bible app today. To me this verse should be more popular as Philippians 4:13 because Proverbs 11:25 is talking about being generous to other people. You never know what other people are going through. Someone could be having the worst time of their life and one complement could change their day and can impact how people
    feel about themselves. It doesn't take any energy to be kind, doesn't take any energy to talk so someone new. That being said I hope whoever reads this. I hope you have a good day.</p>
