    <p>My name is Coleman Stone. I am currently a student at Indiana University Kokomo. I am studying to become a front
        end programmer / full-stack developer and all IT work. I would say I am Java literate, Python literate, html -
        css - PHP literate. I also have been playing music for about 15 years. I would not say I am the next big artist but 
        I can make music for websites and other needs.</button> </p>
